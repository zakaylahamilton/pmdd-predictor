# PMDD Prediction using Deep Learning

This project builds a binary classification model to predict whether a woman has PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) based on features in a health dataset. It uses a neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras, regularization to prevent overfitting, and visualizes training performance.
